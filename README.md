#  Installation & Setup

## Docker
1. __Clone repository__
```
> git clone https://github.com/Vicariss/cve-rest.git
```
2. Create and start containers with docker compose
```
# run this command from root level of the app, where docker-compose.yml is
> docker compose up
```

## Windows

1. __Clone repository__
```
> git clone https://github.com/Vicariss/cve-rest.git
```
2. __Create virtualenv, activate it and install requirements from file__
```
> virtualenv venv
> .\venv\scripts\activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. __Setup & populate MongoDB__
```
> mongorestore --db cve <path_to_dump_folder>
```
4. Run `unit tests` to ensure that everything works properly.
```

```
5. __Run the application using flask cli:__

  Since we have all flask environment variables like FLASK_ENV already specified in .flaskenv file, we don't have to assign them manually
```
> flask run
# by default, flask's built in server run on port 5000, you can change it to whatever port you want
> flask run -p 8080
```


# Usage Example - cURL

__In order to request CVE__, register new user and then log in to obtain access token.


```
# REGISTER 
> curl -X POST -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{""username"": ""..."", ""password"": ""...""}" http://ip:port/user/register

# LOG IN 
> curl -X POST -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{""username"": ""..."", ""password"": ""...""}" http://ip:port/user/login

# REQUEST CVE 
> curl -X GET -i -H "token: <token_id>" http://ip:port/cve?amount=5

# DELETE USER 
> curl -X DELETE -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{""username"":""..."", ""password"":""...""}" http://ip:port/user/delete

# UPDATE USERNAME 
> curl -X PATCH -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{""username"":""..."", ""password"":""..."", ""new_username"":""...""}" http://ip:port/user/update
