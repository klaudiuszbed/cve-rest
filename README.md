# CVE PRO - REST

<p>This project is a REST API designed to quickly fetch & follow Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures from years 1999-2022. 
It aims to make accessing CVE data as quickly and easily as possible.</p>

Integrate it with your existing project(s) or use it for data visualization and analysis. Available to anyone for any kind of purpose.

## Installation & Setup (Windows)
> Keep in mind that this application is not meant to be used and run in production!

1. __Clone repository__
```
> git clone https://github.com/Vicariss/cve-rest.git
```
2. __Create virtualenv, activate it and install requirements from file__
```
> virtualenv venv
> .\venv\scripts\activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. __Setup MongoDB__
```
> mongorestore --db cve <path_to_dump_folder>
```
4. __Run the application using flask cli:__

  Since we have all environment variables like FLASK_ENV already specified in .flaskenv file, we don't have to assign them manually
```
> flask run
# by default, flask's built in server run on port 5000, you can change it to whatever port you want
> flask run -p 8080
```


## Usage Example - cURL

__In order to request CVE__, register new user and then log in to obtain access token.


```
# REGISTER 
> curl -X POST -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{""username"": ""..."", ""password"": ""...""}" http://ip:port/user/register

# LOG IN 
> curl -X POST -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{""username"": ""..."", ""password"": ""...""}" http://ip:port/user/login

# REQUEST CVE 
> curl -X GET -i -H "token: <token_id>" http://ip:port/cve?amount=5

# DELETE USER 
> curl -X DELETE -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{""username"":""..."", ""password"":""...""}" http://ip:port/user/delete

# UPDATE USERNAME
